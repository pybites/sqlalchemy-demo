# sqlalchemy-demo

A script to demo SQLAlchemy models and import a Twitter archive.

To run it, [download your own `all_tweets.js`](https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data) removing `window.YTD.tweet.part0 =` (line 1).

Then run the script like `python -m src.script` (with `sqlalchemy` installed in a virtual environment).
